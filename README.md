A small [React Native project](https://reactnative.dev/) bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) following the [React Navigation Fundamentals](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) tutorial for learning [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/), and following the [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/) documentation to merge and integrate the two packages.
